enc_abstract: Plant roots influence the soil microbiota via physical interaction, secretion, and plant immunity. However, it is unclear whether the root fraction or soil is more important in determining the structure of the prokaryotic or eukaryotic community and whether this varies between plant species. Furthermore, the leaf (phyllosphere) and root microbiotas have a large overlap; however, it is unclear whether this results from colonization of the phyllosphere by the root microbiota. Soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and root endosphere prokaryote-, eukaryote-, and fungus-specific microbiotas of four plant species were analyzed with high-throughput sequencing. The strengths of factors controlling microbiota structure were determined using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) statistics. The origin of the phyllosphere microbiota was investigated using a soil swap experiment. Global microbial kingdom analysis conducted simultaneously on multiple plants shows that cereals, legumes, and Brassicaceae establish similar prokaryotic and similar eukaryotic communities inside and on the root surface. While the bacterial microbiota is recruited from the surrounding soil, its profile is influenced by the root itself more so than by soil or plant species. However, in contrast, the fungal microbiota is most strongly influenced by soil. This was observed in two different soils and for all plant species examined. Microbiota structure is established within 2 weeks of plant growth in soil and remains stable thereafter. A reciprocal soil swap experiment shows that the phyllosphere is colonized from the soil in which the plant is grown.IMPORTANCE Global microbial kingdom analysis conducted simultaneously on multiple plants shows that cereals, legumes, and Brassicaceae establish similar prokaryotic and similar eukaryotic communities inside and on the root surface. While the bacterial microbiota is recruited from the surrounding soil, its profile is influenced by the root fraction more so than by soil or plant species. However, in contrast, the fungal microbiota is most strongly influenced by soil. This was observed in two different soils and for all plant species examined, indicating conserved adaptation of microbial communities to plants. Microbiota structure is established within 2 weeks of plant growth in soil and remains stable thereafter. We observed a remarkable similarity in the structure of a plant's phyllosphere and root microbiotas and show by reciprocal soil swap experiments that both fractions are colonized from the soil in which the plant is grown. Thus, the phyllosphere is continuously colonized by the soil microbiota.

enc_abstract: Gut microbiota-derived endotoxin has been linked to human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the specific causative agents and their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we investigated whether bacterial strains of endotoxin-producing pathogenic species overgrowing in obese human gut can work as causative agents for NAFLD. We further assessed the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) cross talk in this pathogenicity. Nonvirulent strains of Gram-negative pathobionts were isolated from obese human gut and monoassociated with C57BL/6J germfree (GF) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Deletion of waaG in the bacterial endotoxin synthetic pathway and knockout of TLR4 in GF mice were used to further study the underlying mechanism for a causal relationship between these strains and the development of NAFLD. Three endotoxin-producing strains, Enterobacter cloacae B29, Escherichia coli PY102, and Klebsiella pneumoniae A7, overgrowing in the gut of morbidly obese volunteers with severe fatty liver, induced NAFLD when monoassociated with GF mice on HFD, while HFD alone did not induce the disease in GF mice. The commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (ATCC 29148), whose endotoxin activity was markedly lower than that of Enterobacteriaceae strains, did not induce NAFLD in GF mice. B29 lost its proinflammatory properties and NAFLD-inducing capacity upon deletion of the waaG gene. Moreover, E. cloacae B29 did not induce NAFLD in TLR4-deficient GF mice. These nonvirulent endotoxin-producing strains in pathobiont species overgrowing in human gut may work as causative agents, with LPS-TLR4 cross talk as the most upstream and essential molecular event for NAFLD.IMPORTANCE Recent studies have reported a link between gut microbiota and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), showing that germfree (GF) mice do not develop metabolic syndromes, including NAFLD. However, the specific bacterial species causing NAFLD, as well as their molecular cross talk with the host for driving liver disease, remain elusive. Here, we found that nonvirulent endotoxin-producing strains of pathogenic species overgrowing in obese human gut can act as causative agents for induction of NAFLD and related metabolic disorders. The cross talk between endotoxin from these specific producers and the host's TLR4 receptor is the most upstream and essential molecular event for inducing all phenotypes in NAFLD and related metabolic disorders. These nonvirulent endotoxin-producing strains of gut pathogenic species overgrowing in human gut may collectively become a predictive biomarker or serve as a novel therapeutic target for NAFLD and related metabolic disorders.

enc_abstract: Dietary fibers can be utilized to shape the human gut microbiota. However, the outcomes from most dietary fibers currently used as prebiotics are a result of competition between microbes with overlapping abilities to utilize these fibers. Thus, divergent fiber responses are observed across individuals harboring distinct microbial communities. Here, we propose that dietary fibers can be classified hierarchically according to their specificity toward gut microbes. Highly specific fibers harbor chemical and physical characteristics that allow them to be utilized by only a narrow group of bacteria within the gut, reducing competition for that substrate. The use of such fibers as prebiotics targeted to specific microbes would result in predictable shifts independent of the background microbial composition.

enc_abstract: Colorectal adenomas are precancerous lesions of colorectal cancer (CRC) that offer a means of viewing the events key to early CRC development. A number of studies have investigated the changes and roles of gut microbiota in adenoma and carcinoma development, highlighting its impact on carcinogenesis. However, there has been less of a focus on the gut metabolome, which mediates interactions between the host and gut microbes. Here, we investigated metabolomic profiles of stool samples from patients with advanced adenoma (n = 102), matched controls (n = 102), and patients with CRC (n = 36). We found that several classes of bioactive lipids, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, secondary bile acids, and sphingolipids, were elevated in the adenoma patients compared to the controls. Most such metabolites showed directionally consistent changes in the CRC patients, suggesting that those changes may represent early events of carcinogenesis. We also examined gut microbiome-metabolome associations using gut microbiota profiles in these patients. We found remarkably strong overall associations between the microbiome and metabolome data and catalogued a list of robustly correlated pairs of bacterial taxa and metabolomic features which included signatures of adenoma. Our findings highlight the importance of gut metabolites, and potentially their interplay with gut microbes, in the early events of CRC pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Colorectal adenomas are precursors of CRC. Recently, the gut microbiota, i.e., the collection of microbes residing in our gut, has been recognized as a key player in CRC development. There have been a number of gut microbiota profiling studies for colorectal adenoma and CRC; however, fewer studies have considered the gut metabolome, which serves as the chemical interface between the host and gut microbiota. Here, we conducted a gut metabolome profiling study of colorectal adenoma and CRC and analyzed the metabolomic profiles together with paired microbiota composition profiles. We found several chemical signatures of colorectal adenoma that were associated with some gut microbes and potentially indicative of future CRC. This study highlights potential early-driver metabolites in CRC pathogenesis and guides further targeted experiments and thus provides an important stepping stone toward developing better CRC prevention strategies.          

cn_abstract: 结直肠腺瘤是结直肠癌（CRC）的癌前病变，可提供一种查看事件的方法，这些事件是CRC早期发展的关键。大量研究调查了肠道菌群在腺瘤和癌变过程中的变化及其作用，突出了其对癌变的影响。但是，人们对肠道代谢组的关注较少，肠道代谢组介导宿主与肠道微生物之间的相互作用。在这里，我们研究了来自晚期腺瘤（n = 102），匹配的对照（n = 102）和CRC（n = 36）患者粪便样本的代谢组学特征。我们发现，与对照组相比，腺瘤患者的几类生物活性脂质，包括多不饱和脂肪酸，仲胆汁酸和鞘脂，均升高。大多数此类代谢物在CRC患者中显示出方向一致的变化，表明这些变化可能代表了癌变的早期事件。我们还使用这些患者的肠道菌群谱检查了肠道菌群与代谢组的关系。我们发现微生物组和代谢组数据之间的整体关联非常明显，并列出了细菌分类群和代谢组学特征（包括腺瘤的特征）之间的相关性强的列表。我们的发现突出了肠道代谢物在CRC发病机理的早期事件中的重要性以及与肠道微生物相互作用的可能性。重要结直肠腺瘤是CRC的前体。最近，肠道菌群，即我们肠道中的微生物集合，被公认为是CRC发展的关键因素。已经有许多针对结肠直肠腺瘤和CRC的肠道菌群分析研究；然而，很少有研究考虑肠道代谢组，它是宿主和肠道菌群之间的化学界面。在这里，我们进行了大肠腺瘤和CRC的肠道代谢组谱分析，并分析了代谢组学谱以及配对的微生物群组成谱。我们发现了大肠腺瘤的一些化学特征，这些化学特征与某些肠道微生物有关，并可能预示着未来的CRC。这项研究突出了CRC发病机理中潜在的早期驱动物代谢产物，并指导了进一步的针对性实验，从而为开发更好的CRC预防策略提供了重要的踏脚石。

title: Respiratory Viral Infection Alters the Gut Microbiota by Inducing Inappetence [呼吸道病毒感染通过诱导食欲不振改变肠道菌群。]

doi: 10.1128/mBio.03236-19

enc_abstract: Respiratory viral infections are extremely common, but their impacts on the composition and function of the gut microbiota are poorly understood. We previously observed a significant change in the gut microbiota after viral lung infection. Here, we show that weight loss during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or influenza virus infection was due to decreased food consumption, and that the fasting of mice altered gut microbiota composition independently of infection. While the acute phase tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) response drove early weight loss and inappetence during RSV infection, this was not sufficient to induce changes in the gut microbiota. However, the depletion of CD8+ cells increased food intake and prevented weight loss, resulting in a reversal of the gut microbiota changes normally observed during RSV infection. Viral infection also led to changes in the fecal gut metabolome, with a significant shift in lipid metabolism. Sphingolipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) valerate were all increased in abundance in the fecal metabolome following RSV infection. Whether this and the impact of infection-induced anorexia on the gut microbiota are part of a protective anti-inflammatory response during respiratory viral infections remains to be determined.IMPORTANCE The gut microbiota has an important role in health and disease: gut bacteria can generate metabolites that alter the function of immune cells systemically. Understanding the factors that can lead to changes in the gut microbiome may help to inform therapeutic interventions. This is the first study to systematically dissect the pathway of events from viral lung infection to changes in gut microbiota. We show that the cellular immune response to viral lung infection induces inappetence, which in turn alters the gut microbiome and metabolome. Strikingly, there was an increase in lipids that have been associated with the resolution of disease. This opens up new paths of investigation: first, what is the (presumably secreted) factor made by the T cells that can induce inappetence? Second, is inappetence an adaptation that accelerates recovery from infection, and if so, does the microbiome play a role in this?          

cn_abstract: 呼吸道病毒感染极为常见，但对肠道菌群组成和功能的影响知之甚少。我们先前观察到病毒性肺部感染后肠道菌群发生了显着变化。在这里，我们显示呼吸道合胞病毒（RSV）或流感病毒感染期间体重减轻是由于食物消耗减少，并且小鼠的禁食独立于感染而改变了肠道菌群组成。虽然急性期肿瘤坏死因子α（TNF-α）反应导致RSV感染期间早期体重减轻和食欲不振，但这不足以诱发肠道菌群的变化。但是，CD8 +细胞的消耗增加了食物摄入并防止了体重减轻，从而导致了在RSV感染期间通常观察到的肠道菌群变化的逆转。病毒感染还导致粪便肠道代谢组发生变化，脂质代谢发生明显变化。 RSV感染后，粪便代谢组中的鞘脂，多不饱和脂肪酸（PUFA）和短链脂肪酸（SCFA）戊酸酯均增加。这种情况以及感染引起的厌食症对肠道菌群的影响是否是呼吸道病毒感染过程中保护性抗炎反应的一部分尚有待确定。肠道菌群在健康和疾病中具有重要作用：肠道细菌可以产生代谢产物会全身性改变免疫细胞的功能。了解可能导致肠道微生物组改变的因素可能有助于为治疗干预提供依据。这是第一个系统地剖析从病毒性肺部感染到肠道菌群变化的事件途径的研究。我们表明，对病毒性肺部感染的细胞免疫反应会引起食欲不振，进而改变肠道微生物组和代谢组。令人惊讶的是，与疾病消退相关的脂质增加。这开辟了新的研究途径：首先，由T细胞产生的可诱导食欲不振的（可能是分泌的）因子是什么？其次，食欲不振是一种能加速从感染中恢复的适应症吗？如果是，微生物群是否在其中起作用？

enc_abstract: Obesity and associated metabolic disorders are worldwide public health issues. The gut microbiota plays a key role in the pathophysiology of diet-induced obesity. Glycerol monolaurate (GML) is a widely consumed food emulsifier with antibacterial properties. Here, we explore the anti-obesity effect of GML (1,600 mg/kg of body weight) in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. HFD-fed mice were treated with 1,600 mg/kg GML. Integrated microbiome, metabolome, and transcriptome analyses were used to systematically investigate the metabolic effects of GML, and antibiotic treatment was used to assess the effects of GML on the gut microbiota. Our data indicated that GML significantly reduced body weight and visceral fat deposition, improved hyperlipidemia and hepatic lipid metabolism, and ameliorated glucose homeostasis and inflammation in HFD-fed mice. Importantly, GML modulated HFD-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and selectively increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum Antibiotic treatment abolished all the GML-mediated metabolic improvements. A multiomics (microbiome, metabolome, and transcriptome) association study showed that GML significantly modulated glycerophospholipid metabolism, and the abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum strongly correlated with the metabolites and genes that participated in glycerophospholipid metabolism. Our results indicated that GML may be provided for obesity prevention by targeting the gut microbiota and regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism.          

cn_abstract: 肥胖症和相关的代谢紊乱是全世界的公共卫生问题。肠道菌群在饮食诱导的肥胖症的病理生理中起着关键作用。甘油单月桂酸酯（GML）是一种广泛使用的具有抗菌特性的食品乳化剂。在这里，我们探讨了GML（1600 mg / kg体重）在高脂饮食（HFD）喂养的小鼠中的抗肥胖作用。用HFD喂养的小鼠用1,600 mg / kg GML治疗。综合微生物组，代谢组和转录组分析用于系统地研究GML的代谢作用，抗生素治疗用于评估GML对肠道菌群的影响。我们的数据表明GML可以显着降低HFD喂养小鼠的体重和内脏脂肪沉积，改善高脂血症和肝脂质代谢，并改善葡萄糖稳态和炎症。重要的是，GML调节了HFD诱导的肠道菌群失调，并选择性地增加了假双歧双歧杆菌的丰度。抗生素治疗消除了所有GML介导的代谢改善。一项多组学（微生物组，代谢组和转录组）关联研究表明，GML显着调节甘油磷脂代谢，而假长双歧杆菌的丰度与参与甘油磷脂代谢的代谢物和基因密切相关。我们的结果表明，GML可通过靶向肠道菌群和调节甘油磷脂代谢来提供预防肥胖的方法。

enc_abstract: Temporal dynamics of certain human microbiotas have been described in longitudinal studies; variability often relates to modifiable factors or behaviors. Early studies of the urinary microbiota preferentially used samples obtained by transurethral catheterization to minimize vulvovaginal microbial contributions. Whereas voided specimens are preferred for longitudinal studies, the few studies that reported longitudinal data were limited to women with lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms, due to ease of accessing a clinical population for sampling and the impracticality and risk of collecting repeated catheterized urine specimens in a nonclinical population. Here, we studied the microbiota of the LUT of nonsymptomatic, premenopausal women using midstream voided urine (MSU) specimens to investigate relationships between microbial dynamics and personal factors. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and a metaculturomics method called expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC), we characterized the microbiotas of MSU and periurethral swab specimens collected daily for approximately 3 months from a small cohort of adult women. Participants were screened for eligibility, including the ability to self-collect paired urogenital specimens prior to enrollment. In this population, we found that measures of microbial dynamics related to specific participant-reported factors, particularly menstruation and vaginal intercourse. Further investigation of the trends revealed differences in the composition and diversity of LUT microbiotas within and across participants. These data, in combination with previous studies showing relationships between the LUT microbiota and LUT symptoms, suggest that personal factors relating to the genitourinary system may be an important consideration in the etiology, prevention, and/or treatment of LUT disorders.IMPORTANCE Following the discovery of the collective human urinary microbiota, important knowledge gaps remain, including the stability and variability of this microbial niche over time. Initial urinary studies preferentially utilized samples obtained by transurethral catheterization to minimize contributions from vulvovaginal microbes. However, catheterization has the potential to alter the urinary microbiota; therefore, voided specimens are preferred for longitudinal studies. In this report, we describe microbial findings obtained by daily assessment over 3 months in a small cohort of adult women. We found that, similarly to vaginal microbiotas, lower urinary tract (LUT) microbiotas are dynamic, with changes relating to several factors, particularly menstruation and vaginal intercourse. Our study results show that LUT microbiotas are both dynamic and resilient. They also offer novel opportunities to target LUT microbiotas by preventative or therapeutic means, through risk and/or protective factor modification.

enc_abstract: Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) refers to repeated failure to become pregnant after transferring embryos with normal morphology. However, the pathogenesis of RIF remains unrevealed, especially for those without any pathological features. In this study, we characterized the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes of patients with unexplained RIF, while patients who achieved clinical pregnancy in the first frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle were used as controls. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the vaginal microbiota, the vaginal Lactobacillus showed a significant positive correlation with the pregnancy rate, and the RIF group presented higher microbial α-diversity than the control group (P value = 0.016). The metabolomic profile identified 2,507 metabolites, of which 37 were significantly different between the two groups (P value < 0.05, variable importance for the projection [VIP] > 1). Among them, 2',3-cyclic UMP and inositol phosphate were the top two metabolites that were higher in the RIF group, while glycerophospholipids and benzopyran were important metabolites that were lower in the RIF group. A lack of lysobisphosphatidic acid and prostaglandin metabolized from glycerophospholipids will lead to deferred implantation and embryo crowding. Benzopyran, as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, may affect the outcome of pregnancy. All of the changes in metabolite profiles may result in or from the differential microbiota compositions in RIF patients. In conclusion, significant differences were presented in the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes between patients with unexplained RIF and women who became pregnant in the first FET cycle. For the first time, this study elaborates the possible pathogenesis of RIF by investigating the vaginal microbiota and metabolites in RIF patients.IMPORTANCE In vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) is now widely applied for treating infertility, and unexplained recurrent implantation failure (RIF) has become a substantial challenge. We hypothesize that vaginal microbial dysbiosis is associated with RIF, as it is linked to many female reproductive diseases. In this study, we characterized the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes of patients with unexplained RIF, while patients who achieved clinical pregnancy in the first IVF cycle were set as controls. In general, significant differences were discovered in the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes between the two groups. This study is the first detailed elaboration of the vaginal microbiota and metabolites associated with RIF. We believe that our findings will inspire researchers to consider the dynamics of microbiomes related to the microenvironment as a critical feature for future studies of nosogenesis not only for RIF but also for other reproductive diseases.          

cn_abstract: 反复植入失败（RIF）是指在转移具有正常形态的胚胎后反复无法怀孕。但是，RIF的发病机制仍然没有发现，特别是对于那些没有任何病理特征的人。在这项研究中，我们表征了无法解释的RIF患者的阴道微生物群和代谢组，而在第一个冷冻胚胎移植（FET）周期中获得临床妊娠的患者被用作对照。根据阴道菌群的16S rRNA基因测序，阴道乳酸杆菌与妊娠率呈显着正相关，RIF组的微生物α多样性高于对照组（P值= 0.016）。代谢组学特征确定了2,507种代谢物，其中两组之间有37种显着不同（P值<0.05，预测的重要程度[VIP]> 1）。其中，RIF组中2'，3-环UMP和肌醇磷酸是最高的两个代谢产物，而甘油脂和苯并吡喃是RIF组中较低的重要代谢产物。缺乏从甘油磷脂代谢的溶血双磷脂酸和前列腺素会导致推迟植入和胚胎拥挤。苯并吡喃作为选择性雌激素受体调节剂，可能会影响妊娠结局。 RIF患者体内代谢物谱的所有变化都可能导致微生物群组成的差异或由微生物群组成的差异引起。总之，在无法解释的RIF患者和在第一个FET周期中怀孕的妇女之间，阴道微生物群和代谢组存在显着差异。这项研究首次通过研究RIF患者的阴道微生物群和代谢产物来阐明RIF的可能发病机理。 RIF）已成为一项重大挑战。我们假设阴道微生物营养不良与RIF有关，因为它与许多女性生殖疾病有关。在这项研究中，我们表征了无法解释的RIF患者的阴道微生物群和代谢组，同时将在第一个IVF周期中获得临床妊娠的患者作为对照。通常，两组之间的阴道微生物群和代谢组之间存在显着差异。这项研究是首次详细阐述与RIF相关的阴道微生物群和代谢产物。我们相信，我们的发现将激发研究人员将与微环境有关的微生物组的动力学视为未来研究致死现象的重要特征，不仅针对RIF，而且还针对其他生殖疾病。

enc_abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal inflammatory disease of premature infants associated with gut bacterial dysbiosis. Using 16S rRNA-based methods, our laboratory identified an unclassified Enterobacteriaceae sequence (NEC_unk_OTU) with high abundance in NEC fecal samples. We aimed to identify this bacterium and determine its potential role in the disease. NCBI database searches for the 16S sequence, selective culture systems, biotyping and polymerase chain reaction were employed to refine classification of NEC_unk_OTU and identify toxin-encoding genes from the index NEC case. Bacterial cytotoxin production was confirmed by mass spectrometry and apoptosis assays. Additional fecal samples from 9 NEC and 5 non-NEC controls were analyzed using similar methods and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to investigate clonal relationships and define sequence types of the isolates. NEC_unk_OTU was identified as Klebsiella oxytoca, a pathobiont known to cause antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis, but not previously linked to NEC. Including the index case, cytotoxin-producing strains of K. oxytoca were isolated from 6 of 10 subjects with NEC; in these, the K. oxytoca 16S sequence predominated the fecal microbiota. Cytotoxin-producing strains of K. oxytoca also were isolated from 4 of 5 controls; in these, however, the abundance of the corresponding 16S sequence was very low. MLST analysis of the toxin-positive isolates demonstrated no clonal relationships and similar genetic clustering between cases and controls. These results suggest cytotoxin-producing strains of K. oxytoca colonize a substantial proportion of premature infants. Some, perhaps many, cases of NEC may be precipitated by outgrowth of this opportunistic pathogen.

enc_abstract: The lung microbiome plays an important role in the pathophysiological processes associated with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). However, only a few studies using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing have been reported, and the interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and the lung microbiome remain poorly understood. Patients with respiratory symptoms and imaging abnormalities compatible with tuberculosis (TB) were enrolled. We analyzed the lung microbiome in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 30 MTB-positive (MTB+) subjects and 30 MTB negative (MTB-) subjects by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Alpha diversity tended to be lower in the MTB+ group than in the MTB- group. There was a significant difference in beta diversity between the MTB+ and MTB- subjects. MTB+ lung samples were dominated by MTB, while MTB- samples were enriched with Streptococcus, Prevotella, Nesseria, Selenomonas and Bifidobacterium, which more closely resemble the microbial composition of a healthy lung. Network analysis suggested that MTB could greatly impact the microbial community structure. MTB+ and MTB- communities showed distinct functional signatures. Fungal communities were also found to be associated with the presence or absence of MTB. Furthermore, it was confirmed that 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing underrepresents Mycobacterium. This pilot study is the first to explore the interplay between MTB and the host microbiome by using metagenomic sequencing. MTB dominates the lung microbiome of MTB+ subjects, while MTB- subjects have a Streptococcus-enriched microbiome. The 16S approach underrepresents Mycobacterium and is not the best way to study the TB-associated microbiome.

enc_abstract: Many patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) consume alcohol chronically and in large amounts that alter intestinal microbiota, damage the gastrointestinal tract, and thereby injure other organs via malabsorption and intestinal inflammation. We hypothesized that alcohol consumption and subsequent abstinence would change the gut microbiome in adults admitted to a treatment program. Stool and oral specimens, diet data, gastrointestinal assessment scores, anxiety, depression measures and drinking amounts were collected longitudinally for up to 4 weeks in 22 newly abstinent inpatients with AUD who were dichotomized as less heavy drinkers (LHD, <10 drinks/d) and very heavy drinkers (VHD, 10 or more drinks/d). Next-generation 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to measure the gut and oral microbiome at up to ten time points/subject and LHD and VHD were compared for change in principal components, Shannon diversity index and specific genera. The first three principal components explained 46.7% of the variance in gut microbiome diversity across time and all study subjects, indicating the change in gut microbiome following abstinence. The first time point was an outlier in three-dimensional principal component space versus all other time points. The gut microbiota in LHD and VHD were significantly dissimilar in change from day 1 to day 5 (p = .03) and from day 1 to week 3 (p = .02). The VHD drinking group displayed greater change from baseline. The Shannon diversity index of the gut microbiome changed significantly during abstinence in five participants. In both groups, the Shannon diversity was lower in the oral microbiome than gut. Ten total genera were shared between oral and stool in the AUD participants. These data were compared with healthy controls from the Human Microbiome Project to investigate the concept of a core microbiome. Rapid changes in gut microbiome following abstinence from alcohol suggest resilience of the gut microbiome in AUD and reflects the benefits of refraining from the highest levels of alcohol and potential benefits of abstinence.          

cn_abstract: 许多患有酒精使用障碍（AUD）的患者长期大量饮酒，从而改变肠道菌群，损害胃肠道，从而通过吸收不良和肠道炎症伤害其他器官。我们假设饮酒和随后的戒酒会改变接受治疗方案的成年人的肠道微生物组。纵向收集了22名刚戒断的AUD住院患者的粪便和口腔标本，饮食数据，胃肠道评估评分，焦虑，抑郁量度和饮酒量，长达4周，这些患者被分为轻度饮酒者（LHD，<10杯/天）和非常沉重的饮酒者（VHD，每天喝10杯或更多）。进行了下一代16 S rRNA基因测序，以测量肠道和口腔微生物组的多达10个时间点/受试者，并比较了LHD和VHD的主要成分，香农多样性指数和特定属的变化。前三个主要成分解释了整个时间段和所有研究对象的肠道微生物组多样性的46.7％的变化，表明禁欲后肠道微生物组的变化。第一个时间点是三维主成分空间与所有其他时间点的离群值。从第1天到第5天（p = .03）和从第1天到第3周（p = .02），LHD和VHD中的肠道菌群变化显着不同。 VHD饮酒组与基线相比显示出更大的变化。在五位参与者的节制期间，肠道微生物组的香农多样性指数发生了显着变化。在两组中，口腔微生物组的香农多样性均低于肠道。 AUD参加者的口腔和粪便共有10个属。将这些数据与人类微生物组计划的健康对照进行比较，以研究核心微生物组的概念。戒酒后肠道微生物组的快速变化表明肠道微生物组在澳元中具有复原力，反映出戒除酒精含量最高的好处以及戒酒的潜在好处。

enc_abstract: The normal development of the pulmonary system is critical to transitioning from placental-dependent fetal life to alveolar-dependent newborn life. Human lung development and disease have been difficult to study due to the lack of an in vitro model system containing cells from the large airways and distal alveolus. This article describes a system that allows human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to differentiate and form three-dimensional (3D) structures that emulate the development, cytoarchitecture, and function of the lung ("organoids"), containing epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations, and including the production of surfactant and presence of ciliated cells. The organoids can also be invested with mesoderm derivatives, differentiated from the same human pluripotent stem cells, such as alveolar macrophages and vasculature. Such lung organoids may be used to study the impact of environmental modifiers and perturbagens (toxins, microbial or viral pathogens, alterations in microbiome) or the efficacy and safety of drugs, biologics, and gene transfer. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

enc_abstract: Helicobacter pylori is the most prevalent infection worldwide, while non-alcoholic fatty liver disease emerged as the most frequent liver disease. The common occurrence can be either by chance or due to certain pathogenetic factors. Epidemiologic studies revealed that the risk of non-alcoholic liver disease is increased in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori. DNA fragments of Helicobacter pylori were rarely identified in human samples of liver carcinoma and fatty liver. Helicobacter pylori could influence the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver either by hormonal (ghrelin? gastrin? insulin?), or by effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1 and 8, tumor necrosis factor ɑ, interferon ɣ) and by changes of gut microbiome as well. Probiotic supplementation could improve some clinical parameters of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and eradication rates of Helicobacter pylori. Regimens used for eradication can be safely administered, although non-alcoholic fatty liver increases the risk of drug-induced liver damage. Controlled studies of the effect of eradication on the development and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver are warranted.

enc_abstract: The early-life gut microbiota is associated with potential development of diseases in adulthood. The sterile womb paradigm has been challenged by recent reports that revealed the presence of the meconium, amniotic fluid, and placenta microbiome. This study aimed to explore the maternal origin of the microbiota of neonate meconium by using the PacBio single-molecule real-time circular consensus sequencing technology. Such technology could produce high fidelity reads of full-length 16S rRNA genes, improving the sensitivity and specificity of taxonomic profiling. It also reduced the risk of false positives. This study analyzed the full-length 16S rRNA-based microbiota of maternal samples (amniotic fluid, feces, vaginal fluid, saliva) and first-pass meconium of 39 maternal-neonate pairs. Alpha- and beta-diversity analyses revealed sample type-specific microbiota features. Most sample types were dominated by sequences representing different genera (Lactobacillus and Curvibacter in the amniotic fluid and vaginal fluid microbiota; Bacillus and Escherichia/Shigella in the meconium microbiota; Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium in the maternal fecal microbiota; Streptococcus and Prevotella in the maternal saliva microbiota). Moreover, specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in all sample types. Dyad analysis revealed common OTUs between the meconium microbiota and microbiota of multiple maternal samples. The meconium microbiota shared more features with the amniotic fluid microbiota than the maternal fecal and vaginal microbiota. Our results strongly suggested that the meconium microbiota was seeded from multiple maternal body sites, and the amniotic fluid microbiota contributed most to the seeding of the meconium microbiota among the investigated maternal body sites.

enc_abstract: The gut microbiome in newborns may be strongly influenced by their intrinsic host microenvironmental factors (e.g., the gestational age) and has been linked to their short-term growth and potentially future health. It is yet unclear whether early microbiota composition is significantly different in newborns conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) when compared with those who were conceived spontaneously. Additionally, little is known about the effect of gut microbiota composition on weight gain in early infancy. We aimed to characterize the features and the determinants of the gut microbiome in ART newborns and to assess the impact of early microbiota composition on their weight gain in early infancy in mother-infant dyads enrolled in the China National Birth Cohort (CNBC). Among 118 neonates born by ART and 91 neonates born following spontaneous conception, we observed significantly reduced gut microbiota α-diversity and declined Bacteroidetes relative abundance in ART neonates. The microbiota composition of ART neonates was largely driven by specific ART treatments, hinting the importance of fetus intrinsic host microenvironment on the early microbial colonization. Following up these neonates for six months after their births, we observed the effects of gut microbiome composition on infant rapid weight gaining. Collectively, we identified features and determinants of the gut microbiota composition in ART neonates, and provided evidence for the importance of microbiota composition in neonatal growth.
